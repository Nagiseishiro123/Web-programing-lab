                  since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                  scrambled it to make type specimen book. It has survived not only five
                  ceturies, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
                  essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release
                  of Letraset sheets contraining Loren ipsum passages, and more recently
                  with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
                  of Loren Ipsum.
